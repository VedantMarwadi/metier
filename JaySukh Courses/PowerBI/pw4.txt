single value parameter system
I want to design feedback system by using dax
take new report page
goto home menu--modeling tab---new parameter
name--feedback
whole number
minimum=1
maximum=5
ok

it will create a slicer of 1 to 5 in new page
goto the data view
select feedback table
select new column
press windows key+dot---it will display you emoji
Emoji=switch(true(),feedback[feedback]=1,"emoji",
feedback[feedback]=2,"emoji",
feedback[feedback]=3,"emoji",
feedback[feedback]=4,"emoji",
feedback[feedback]=5,"emoji")

goto the report view
take card visual--take emojis to this

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now create simple dashboard

take new page
select text table--customer name,total cost,total sales--arrange it
add border,shadow

take card--distinct customers-- set title to Total customers

take slicer--country--select dropdown--border,shadow

take card--total transactions--format it
take card--total Profit--format it


area chart--product name--axis
		total sales--value
		sales LY-secondary values

if you change slicer value it will automatically give effect to all visuals
so what if i want to keep some visuals static so they do not make changes by slicer

select slicer---go to the format tab--edit interaction
select none option for all card visual

so if you select value from slicer other visuals are changed
but three card visuals are became static


take new page named it perfomance report last page which we have created
take donut chart--take product name and total sales

take line and column cluster chart---
country-axis
total sales--column value
total profit--line values

how to create filters in the report

2)page level
3)report level

1)visual level
select any one visual--select state and drag it at add data fields
only this visual is filtered not other

2)page level
select any one visual--select state and drag it at filter on this page
all the visual is filtered

3)report level
select any one visual--select state and drag it at filter all the pages
all the visual are filtered in all pages

what is the difference between sclicer and filter
if you apply a filter for each page then you have to apply filter for individual page
but in slicer can connected to all pages easily
supoose i want to apply slicer for other pages then
view option --synk slicer option
in this option you can sync slicer for different pages
